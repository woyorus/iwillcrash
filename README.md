# IWillCrash

A radically simple program and associated that crashes after 15 seconds from launch.
I find it useful for testing some Container-as-a-Service systems and such.

### Usage (as Docker image)
```
docker run woyorus/iwillcrash
```

### Usage (from source code - Go compiler required)
```
go run main.go
```
